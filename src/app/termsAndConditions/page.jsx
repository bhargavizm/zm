      <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>16. SOCIAL MEDIA INTEGRATION</h2><br/>
      <p>Our Services allow you to connect your account with accounts you hold on third-party platforms ("Third-Party Accounts") by either providing your login credentials or authorizing access as allowed by the terms of those platforms. By doing so, you confirm that you are authorized to share your login information or grant us access without violating any terms of the applicable Third-Party Account, and without requiring us to pay fees or be subject to any restrictions from the third-party provider.<br/><br/>
      When you link a Third-Party Account, you allow us to access and potentially store content from that account (“Social Network Content”)—including but not limited to your friend list—so it can be displayed on or used within our Services. You may also allow us to send and receive additional information, as disclosed at the time of linking.<br/><br/>
      Based on your privacy settings, personally identifiable information you've posted on Third-Party Accounts may become visible through our Services. If access to a Third-Party Account is revoked or the account becomes unavailable, any associated content may also become inaccessible.<br/><br/>
      You can disconnect your Third-Party Accounts at any time via your account settings or by contacting us. We will attempt to delete any data retrieved through those accounts, excluding your username and profile picture that may remain linked to your account.<br/><br/>
      Please note: Your relationship with third-party service providers is governed by your agreements with them. We do not review or verify Social Network Content and are not responsible for its accuracy, legality, or any other issues. You also agree that we may access your contacts or email address book solely to help identify others who use our Services.<br/><br/>
      </p><br/>
      <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>17. THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND CONTENT</h2><br/>
      <p>Our Services may include links to external websites ("Third-Party Websites") and display content from third parties ("Third-Party Content")—such as articles, images, videos, apps, or other media. ZMqrcodeservices does not monitor or verify these third-party materials and disclaims any responsibility for their accuracy, legality, or appropriateness.<br/><br/>
      The presence of such links or content does not imply our endorsement or approval. Your use of any Third-Party Websites or Content is entirely at your own risk, and Zmqrcodeservices will not be liable for any losses or damages that result from your interactions with them.<br/><br/>
      If you choose to engage with Third-Party Websites or Content—whether by visiting, using, or installing—you do so voluntarily and understand that these Legal Terms no longer apply. We strongly encourage reviewing the privacy policies and terms of any third-party services you interact with.<br/><br/>
      Any transactions, purchases, or communications with third-party providers are strictly between you and them. ZMqrcodeservices neither guarantees nor is responsible for the goods, services, or content offered on such platforms. You agree to release us from any liability arising from these interactions or from using Third-Party Content.<br/><br/>
