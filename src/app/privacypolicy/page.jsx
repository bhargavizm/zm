      {/* (b) Preference-Based Advertising */}
      <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold">(b) Preference-Based Advertising</h3>
      <p>
        We partner with third-party service providers, including advertising
        networks and analytics companies, who may place cookies on your device
        to collect non-PII about your online activities. This data helps them
        deliver interest-based advertisements ("Third-Party Ads") on our sites
        and across the web.
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        If you would like to opt out of interest-based advertising or have
        questions about this practice, please contact us directly.
      </p><br/>

      <h4 className="text-1lg font-semibold">Additional Notes on Third-Party Ad Opt-Outs</h4><br/>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>
          Opt-out tools for third-party advertisements apply to all ad networks,
          even those we don’t partner with directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Opting out of our ads does not automatically exclude you from
          third-party ads, and vice versa.
        </li>
        <li>
          These tools rely on “opt-out cookies.” If you switch devices, change
          browsers, or clear your cookies, you’ll need to opt out again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some browser extensions or privacy tools may interfere with ad
          cookies. We cannot guarantee our services will function correctly when
          such tools are enabled.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">5. How Do We Handle Your Social Logins?</h2><br/>

        information like your name, email address, friends list, profile picture, and any
        other data you’ve made public on that platform. <br/><br/>This information is used solely for
        the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or within our Services. We do not
        control how these platforms collect or use your data.
        Please refer to their privacy policies to understand their practices and manage your
        privacy settings accordingly.

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, your data may be transferred, stored, or processed
        outside your home country.
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        Our primary servers are in the United States. If you access our services from another
        country, your data may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. or in countries
        where we or our partners operate.
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, or Switzerland, we take

        <strong>In Short:</strong> We retain your information only as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy.
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        We store your data only as long as needed to deliver services, comply with legal
        requirements, or resolve disputes. Typically, no data is retained more than 14 days
        after account termination unless required by law. Certain server and access logs may
        be kept for up to 180 days or longer, especially for security and auditing purposes.

      <p>
        When your data is no longer needed, we will delete or anonymize it. If deletion is
        not immediately possible (e.g., backup storage), we will securely isolate it until it
        can be removed.

      </p><br/>
      <p>
        We use secure server hosting, encryption (e.g., SSL), firewalls, and access controls
        to safeguard your data. However, no internet transmission is completely secure. We
        cannot guarantee 100% protection and are not liable for unauthorized access due to
        factors outside our control.
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        In the event of a data breach involving your personally identifiable information
        (PII), we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible, unless delayed for legal or
        security reasons.
